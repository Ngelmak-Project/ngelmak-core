# 📱 Ngelmak Thruline Core

The **Ngelmak Thruline Core** is the heart of the Ngelmak ecosystem, responsible for handling the **social media logic** of the platform.  
It manages posts, comments, likes, and user interactions, and integrates with other microservices through the API Gateway.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🗄 **Postgres Database** — Persistent storage for social media data  
- 🔑 **Vault Integration** — Secure management of secrets (JWT keys, DB credentials)  
- 📡 **Future-ready Messaging** — RabbitMQ & Kafka planned for event-driven communication  
- 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment** — Easy containerization and portability  

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- **Spring Boot** — Core framework  
- **Postgres** — Relational database  
- **Vault** — Secret management  
- **RabbitMQ / Kafka** — (planned) message brokers for async communication

## 🔑 Vault Configuration (Short Doc)

Thruline Core uses **HashiCorp Vault** to fetch secrets (e.g., JWT signing key, DB credentials).  
Here’s a minimal configuration example:

```yaml
cloud:
  vault:
    uri: http://localhost:8200
    authentication: approle
    app-role:
      role-id: ${VAULT_ROLE_ID}
      secret-id: ${VAULT_SECRET_ID}
    kv:
      enabled: true
      backend: kv
      default-context: jjwt
```

### Steps:
1. Start Vault locally:  
   ```bash
   vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=root
   ```
2. Enable KV secrets engine:  
   ```bash
   vault secrets enable -path=secret kv
   ```
3. Store secrets:  
   ```bash
   vault kv put secret/thruline-core db-username=postgres db-password=supersecret jwt-secret=myjwtsecret
   ```
4. Configure `VAULT_ROLE_ID` and `VAULT_SECRET_ID` in the environment.

## 🐳 Dockerfile

A sample `Dockerfile` for building the Thruline Core service:

```dockerfile
# --- Build Stage ---
FROM maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy Maven descriptor and download dependencies
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code and build
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package

# --- Runtime Stage ---
FROM openjdk:21-jdk AS runner

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built JAR from builder stage
COPY --from=builder ./app/target/*-SNAPSHOT.jar ./app.jar

# Expose service port
EXPOSE 4005

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Build & Run
```bash
# Build the JAR with Maven
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Build Docker image
docker build -t ngelmak-thruline-core .

# Run container
docker run -p 4005:4005 ngelmak-thruline-core
```

This way, the final image is **lightweight** (only contains JDK + compiled JAR) while the heavy Maven build tools stay in the builder stage.
